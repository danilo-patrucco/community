title: "Add Exclude File Option to Helm Lint Command"

## Abstract
This proposal introduces enhancements to the `helm lint` command, allowing the exclusion of specific files or patterns through a `.helmlintconfig.yaml` file. Additionally, a `--lint-config-file` flag will be added to specify alternative locations for the `.helmlintconfig.yaml` file. This feature is particularly useful in projects with multiple sub-charts. An environment variable `HELM_LINT_CONFIG_FILE` will also be introduced to mirror the functionality of the flag.

## Motivation
In large Helm charts, maintainers often encounter scenarios where certain files or configurations, while deviating from standard linting rules, are nonetheless acceptable. The current helm lint process indiscriminately evaluates all files within a chart, leading to the generation of potentially irrelevant warnings or errors. Introducing options to exclude specific files and to specify locations for config files would greatly streamline the linting process. This adjustment would especially benefit situations where imported subcharts are flagged with low-priority lint errors that maintainers would prefer to suppress.

## Rationale
The aim of this proposal is to grant developers and integrators more control over the linting process by enabling:
- Exclusions for files imported or managed by third parties that are not directly editable.
- Exclusions for files that may not adhere to static linting rules.
- Exclusions for files containing intentional deviations from standard practices due to specific deployment scenarios.

The `.helmlintconfig.yaml` file will support simple patterns for matching files and directories, enhancing ease of management. The `--lint-config-file` flag will facilitate centralized management of lint exclusions in complex projects.

## Specification
### `.helmlintconfig.yaml` File Format
The `.helmlintconfig.yaml` file enables chart developers to specify glob patterns for both file paths and error stirngs to exclude from linting. The format is YAML, with patterns specified under a `lintConfig` key, making future extensions for additional configurations feasible.

#### Example
```
# .helmlintconfig.yaml file example
lintIgnore:
  - pathIgnore: "migrations/templates/job.yaml"                                       # Ignores all errors from this file
  - errorIgnore: "chart metadata is missing these dependencies**"                     # Ignores all icon errors
  - pathIgnore: "gitlab/templates/shared-secrets/self-signed-cert-job.yml"
    errorIgnore: "<include 'fullname' .>"                                             # Ignores this specific error but not other errors in the file
```

### Command Behavior
When `helm lint` is executed, it checks for the presence of a `.helmlintconfig.yaml` file in the chart directory or at a location specified by the `--lint-config-file` flag or by the environment variable `HELM_LINT_CONFIG_FILE`. The command then parses this file to exclude any files or directories matching the patterns specified, including specific error lines.

## Backwards Compatibility
This proposal introduces no breaking changes. Charts without a `.helmlintconfig.yaml` file or those not using the `--lint-config-file` flag will function as before.

## Security Implications
No significant security implications are expected as the `.helmlintconfig.yaml` file is processed locally by `helm lint`, without modifying chart content or involving network activity.

## How to Teach This
Documentation for the `.helmlintconfig.yaml` file and the `--lint-config-file` flag will be integrated into the official Helm documentation under the `helm lint` section. Detailed examples and common patterns will be provided to assist new users.

## Open Issues
- Developing an Effective and User-Friendly Pattern Syntax and Rule Configurations: We are considering the design of a flexible and intuitive pattern syntax for the `.helmlintconfig.yaml` file that supports rule-specific configurations and exclusions. This enables users to control lint behaviors on a per-rule basis. Additionally, introducing named lint rules, akin to those in yamllint, will provide a foundation for more sophisticated configuration features, including rule-specific settings and extensions of a "default" configuration set. This could also facilitate the introduction of features like error code suppression across the board (hypothetically, using `errorCode: H019`). This change will require a strong refactoring of the linting code to accommodate the new configuration and rule management systems.
- In-File Annotations for Excluding Chart Sections: Exploring the possibility of in-file annotations that would let developers temporarily exclude specific sections of a chart from linting. This feature would provide granular control directly within Helm chart files.
- Future Enhancements and Extensibility: The Open issues proposed changes to the Helm linting system will likely require significant modifications to the existing codebase, the basic design outlined in HIP-0019 won't. As such, these future enhancements could be implemented in phases, starting with foundational features like rule naming and extending to more complex configurations. This phased approach will help ensure stability and usability while expanding the linting capabilities of Helm.
